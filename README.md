## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a data scientist with a strong focus on building recommendation systems that deliver personalized and relevant user experiences. This space is dedicated to sharing projects, experiments, and ideas centered around collaborative filtering, machine learning algorithms, and data-driven personalization techniques.

My work revolves around leveraging user behavior, item characteristics, and interaction data to create intelligent systems that predict preferences and improve engagement. Iâ€™ve worked with both memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering methods, and Iâ€™m continually exploring new approaches to improve accuracy and scalability.

Using Python as my primary programming language, I work with libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Surprise to build prototypes and test models. I also use visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights and communicate results. When working with larger datasets or deploying models, I integrate tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and cloud platforms to handle performance and scalability challenges.

Beyond algorithm development, Iâ€™m also interested in evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, RMSE, and diversity to ensure that recommendation systems not only perform well but also align with business goals and user satisfaction.

This repository includes a mix of end-to-end recommendation projects, notebooks exploring specific techniques, and reusable code snippets for common tasks in recommendation system development. Whether you're just getting started or looking to explore more advanced approaches, I hope you find something useful here.

Feel free to explore the code, fork a project, or open a discussionâ€”Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, feedback, and learning from the wider data science community.

Thanks for visiting, and stay tuned for more experiments, improvements, and insights in the world of intelligent recommendations.
